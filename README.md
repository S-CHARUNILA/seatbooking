To view my website:https://github.com/S-CHARUNILA/seatbooking.git
This project is a simple and user-friendly seat booking system designed to help users reserve seats for events, cinemas, conferences, or transportation. The website allows users to view available seats, choose their desired seat(s), and complete the booking process easily.
